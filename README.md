# Task Commander - Python

Just a small utility to help me manage and prioritize my tasks, which are each Obsidian markdown notes with frontmatter metadata.

Location of my tasks, when accessing from within WSL Ubuntu:

`/mnt/c/Users/f77541a/repos/kb/2 Areas/Journal/tasks`


```bash
pip3 install pyyaml
```
